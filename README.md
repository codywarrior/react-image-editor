If react-image-editor doesn't cover your needs I recommend taking a look at [Pintura](https://pqina.nl/pintura/?ref=react-image-editor)

Pintura features cropping, rotating, flipping, filtering, annotating, and lots of additional functionality to cover all your image and video editing needs on both mobile and desktop devices.
